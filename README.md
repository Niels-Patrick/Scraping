# Scraping

This is a very simple program that scraps the Python "fake jobs" website, parses and filter the result to print in the console only the Python developer jobs' title, company name, location and the apply URL link.

## Package requirements

Two packages are needed:
- Requests
- Beautiful Soup

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install Requests and Beautiful Soup.

```bash
pip install requests
```

```bash
pip install beautifulsoup4
```

## Usage

Open the scraping.py file on a Python IDE (PyCharm, VSCode) and run it. The result is printed in the command console.
